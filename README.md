# HEALTH ASSURANCE APP 

## INTRODUCTION
This project is based on the observation that there are several medical applications used in pharmacies, hospitals, health structures or even patients. Our project is based on the fact that there are several medical applications used in pharmacies, hospitals, health structures or even patients. These applications, despite the fact that they each use similar data in their own way, do not manage to interact with each other because the modeling of their databases is often too different. There are nowadays international standards that define how medical applications should be done. Nowadays, there are international standards that define how medical applications should be done.



In computer science, there are standards to standardize the materials and the data; thus in network there are the norms OSI and TCP/IP that define different layers that the data must follow on the network. In communication there are also layers that the information must follow and for each layer there are standards 
The medical applications all have a different implementation system and interfaces, so to interact it is necessary to maintain several interfaces at the same time. However by defining a common protocol it will reduce the maintenance work 

## OBJECTIVES
The general objective of this work is to demonstrate the importance of standardization of medical applications used in Togo.
 Our specific objectives are:
- Build a microservices apps for a Health Insurance,
- Respect the recommandations of [FHIR](https://build.fhir.org/http.html)
